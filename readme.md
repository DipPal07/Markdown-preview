# Markdown Previewer

A simple web application that allows users to write Markdown text and see the live preview of the rendered HTML in real-time. The application uses **JavaScript** and **marked.js** to render Markdown.

## Features

- **Real-time Markdown preview**: As users type Markdown text, the preview is updated live.
- **Responsive design**: The application adapts to different screen sizes, with special adjustments for mobile and tablet views.
- A clear/reset button to clear the textarea


### Additional Features:
- **Copy to clipboard**: You can easily copy the rendered Markdown text.
- **Local Storage Support**: Your Markdown text is saved in the browser's local storage, so it persists even after refreshing or closing the browser.
